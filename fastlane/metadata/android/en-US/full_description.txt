<p><br><b>Permissions:</b></p>
<p>The app uses ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and INTERNET permsisions, because it shows home ads and they open the default browser on the device, going to one of our other apps' page on the store or on the website of Metatrans Apps.
To be more precise, if the other app is available on the store, from which the app is downloaded, then opens the app page of the other app on the same store. If still the app is not available on the store, then opens the app page on our website.
The app pages on our website have app demo video on YouTube, so a connection to youtube domain will also be listed in order to visualize the page in the browser.
Our website is created by WordPress, so connections to other domains could be opened as well for technical purposes (e.g. downloading text fonts css).</p>
